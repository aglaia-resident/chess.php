# FEN generation

as simple as it should be :-)

Example:

```php
<?php
use \Ryanhs\Chess\Chess;

$chess = new Chess;
.
.
.
echo $chess->fen() . PHP_EOL;
```

or maybe somehow its more convenient to use alias $chess->generateFen()

```php
<?php
use \Ryanhs\Chess\Chess;

$chess = new Chess;
.
.
.
echo $chess->generateFen() . PHP_EOL;
```
